# Minecraft Clone

-This is my first attempt of creating a game similar to Minecraft,
 All the Included content (codes, textures, shaders, etc...) were created be ME so do not expect something
 perfect and very performant.

# Known Issues
-The Light Engine is somewhat broken, where the faces across chunks will be lit 100%, and light won't move across chunks.
-Again with the Light Engine, it's so expensive and Iam planning on re-writing it with Unity's Jobs multi-threading solution.
-Character movement is so broken and barely working due to colission detection being not "finished".

## Notes
-You can sent any pull requests cuz working on this project is taking so much of my time and I would love some help Improving this clone.
